## Hoi

Welcome humans! I'm Arri! I am a Senior Software engineer with a knack for frontend development and a passion for Accessability! 
I have just now started doing talks at conferences but I love it and am hoping to do more! 

## Projects

I spend most of my development time with work and like to spend my free time outdoors!

### Brewlab

This is a system that I intend to use to manage my brewing. It uses <a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>
for the frontend, and <a href="https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GraphQL-Yoga</a> on the backend. 
Data is persisted using MongoDB. This is currently live but is only used for my personal brewing projects.

### Untitled Todo List
This is a simple todo list in the style of the one found in Untitled Goose Game. It persists your items to local storage and you can cross them off when they are done.

## Hoi

Welcome humans! I'm Arri, a Senior Software Engineer with a knack for frontend development 
and a passion for accessibility. I have just now started doing talks at conferences but I 
love it and am hoping to do more!

## Projects

I do most of my development at work and like to spend my free time outdoors,
however there are some side projects I have made for fun. Feel free to check them out.

### Codium

Codium is a design system I am building that was inspired by my nilJS project. I am trying to learn
more about the design aspects of accessibility so my goal is to make a design system that is 
AAA WCAG compliant. When I am further along with development I will be happy ot share the code. 
For now you can check out my progress on its site.

### AutoHeader

Common problem that I run into is leveling headings properly. I created this so I can easily specify 
"up," "down," or "same" for heading levels.

### nilJS

This is a simple component library that I made. It contains HTML and CSS only (no JavaScript) 
snippets that you can plug into your project. My intent is to encourage more developers to see 
how powerful CSS is and how much you can do even with JavaScript Disabled.

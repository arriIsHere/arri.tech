## Hoi

Welcome humans! I'm Arri! I am a Senior Software engineer with a knack for frontend development and a passion for Accessability! 
I have just now started doing talks at conferences but I love it and am hoping to do more! 

## Projects

I spend most of my development time with work and like to spend my free time outdoors! 
However there are some side projects I have made for fun! Feel free to check them out.

### Brewlab

This is a system that I intend to use to manage my brewing. It uses 
<a href="https://vuejs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>
for the frontend, and 
<a href="https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
GraphQL-Yoga</a>
on the backend. Data is persisted using MongoDB. This is currently live but is only used for my 
personal brewing projects.

### Untitled Todo List
This is a simple todo list in the style of the one found in Untitled Goose Game. It persists your
items to local storage and you can cross them off when they are done.

### Campaign Setting
Originally intended for a one-off campaign, I made the Shadowlance setting and have continued to 
expand on it. My players and myself are now several years into this game. I finally decided to make 
a stylized website for this setting. I have licensed it under creative commons and provided the 
source code for those wishing to use it, or draw upon it for their games.

### nilJS

This is a simple component library that I made. It contains HTML and CSS only (no JavaScript) 
snippets that you can plug into your project. My intent is to encourage more developers to see 
how powerful CSS is and how much you can do even with javascript Disabled.

## Talks

I am new to conference talks but I have been having fun and can't wait to do more!

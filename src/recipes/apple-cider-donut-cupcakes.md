a coworker suggested that it might taste yummy as a cupcake. I decided to give it
a try and they turned out delicious!

*1 Batch Yields: 12 cupcakes*

### Apple cider concentrate

- 1 1/2 Cups Apple cider

1. Put Apple cider in a sauce pan and bring to a simmer over medium/low heat.
1. Reduce heat to keep at a simmer but avoid boiling.
1. Stir occasionally until cider has reduced volume to half (3/4 cup).

> Note: reduced apple cider
> I highly recommend reducing the cider beforehand, it's simple but time consuming.
> It keeps well in the fridge, and you can make extra if you plan on making mutiple batches, 
> or have some other baking projects you want to use it for.
